# Results to CSV
Gymnastics results can often be difficult to obtain in a usable format for analytics. Usually, the results are stored in a generated PDF by whatever scoring system the competition is using. Therefore, it is possible to retrieve the results by scraping the PDFs.

This R script currently supports the results PDFs from Longines which means we can extract results from several big competitions, including the World Championships. The script is currently set to grab the qualification results from the 2018 worlds, but it should be easy to modify to process similar PDFs.

You can find these PDFs on either the [Longines website](http://www.longinestiming.com/#!/gymnastics/) or on [Gymnastics Results](https://www.gymnasticsresults.com/index.html)
